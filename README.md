# DeadlyDungeon 💀💀💀
Console Game C++ Project

I created this game as a school project, it is based on 10 rooms in which we encounter opponents and by choosing one of 3 options we can attack the monster, try to dodge its attack or drink a health potion. 
There is a little plot twist at the end, I also included a bit of humor 😎

made in 2020 👀
